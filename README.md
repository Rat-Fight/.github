What Does Rat Fight Do?
Rat Fight is an FRC (FIRST Robotics Competition) team dedicated to teaching robotics to high school students in the Madison County area. Berea College students and industry professionals mentor these students, guiding them through the engineering, programming, and teamwork skills needed to succeed in competitive robotics.
Each year, teams receive a brand-new game challenge and have just eight weeks to design, build, and program a robot from scratch.
